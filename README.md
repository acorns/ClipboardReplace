# ClipboardReplace
Copy, replace, paste.

### Status

Don't expect much from me, this project is pretty much dead, just releasing it due to a request.
Feel free to fork it and do w/e you want.

### About
Copy stuff to clipboard and use this program to find+replace text on your clipboard contents, no need to open up notepad or some fancy editor. Updates in real-time. Supports most common features such as Regex, whole-word-only, case senstivity and none of those things.

### Screenshots
*(I use a high-contrast OS theme. this program itself is **not** themed)*
